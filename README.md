# horiseon-refactor

## Description

The website required the following improvements:

- Icons and images needed accessible alt attributes
- Clear and logical semantic HTML elements
- The title elements reuired a concise and descriptive title
- A broken link needed to be fixed
- The CSS file required lots of consolidation and organization due to redundancies, unnecassary classes/ids and the introduction of semantic HTML elements
- The CSS file also required clear commenting

The website now:

- Better meets accessibility standards
- Functions correctly
- Is more efficient
- Is better set up for future development
